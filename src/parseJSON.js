// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

/*
Description: Takes a string and outputs a boolean, string, array, object, or
number, depending on the input
*/


// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json){
  // 

};
